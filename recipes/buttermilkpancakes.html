        <h1>Buttermilk Pancakes Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../img/buttermilkpancakes.jpg" alt="buttermilk pancakes" width="50%">
        <p>These soft, fluffy hotcakes are my favorite to whip up for my kids on a leisurely Saturday morning. 
        I love the delicious and airy soft texture the buttermilk creates.
        I like to serve with fruit and maple syrup and sometimes we I feel extra sweet, I'll add in some chocolate chips.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>385g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>50g sugar</li>
            <li>10g (1 1/2 tsp) salt</li>
            <li>11g (1 tbsp) baking powder</li>
            <li>5-6g (1 1/2 tsp) baking soda</li>
            <li>460ml/g (2 1/4 cups) milk</li>
            <li>60ml/g (1/4 cup) oil</li>
            <li>8-10g (1 tbsp) vanilla extract</li>
            <li>55-60g (1/4 cup) apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix together the wet ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Fold the ingredients with a rubber spatula until loosely combined (around 20-25 times). Lumps will form and that is ok. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Heat up a griddle (or a frying pan on medium heat). Add a heaping dollop of salted whipped butter (I used regular butter) on the griddle until melted. Scoop the batter in a large spoon and drop them in the griddle. Do not stir the batter!</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes once the bubbles are popping through and the batter is slightly set. Do not push down the pancake with your spatula! The pancakes are done if the surface springs back when gently pushed down.</li>
            <li>Serve pancakes with maple syrup and salted whipped butter.</li>
        </ol>
