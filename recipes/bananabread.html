            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (215g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda (6g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt (6g)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (3g)</li>

            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature (113g)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 very ripe bananas mashed (430g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla (5ml)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>

            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the sugar and butter together on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, stopping to scrape down the bowl between each. Beat in the vanilla extract. Mix the mashed bananas in and then add the dry ingredients and fold together until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes then remove and finish cooling on a wire rack.</li>
